## Fall 2022 Data Science Intern Challenge 

The following questions were part of the Fall 2022 Data Science Intern Challenge for Shopify. Though not selected, 
I feel as though my work here is a good showcase of my knowledge. My work for Question #1 is in a JupyterNotebook
included in this folder. The answers for Question #2 are attached to a file labeled 'SQL_Questions' included in this
folder.


## Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. 
We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day 
window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a 
relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.
What metric would you report for this dataset?
What is its value?

Outliers have the ability to cause issues in our statistical analysis, as larger outliers can increase the 
value of our mean. Upon analysis of the data, we discovered that the largest outlier was $704,000. 

Determining the median, which is $284, would be a more effective way of determining the central tendency 
of the data. Also, observing the range of data between the lower and upper quartile ($163 and $390, respectively) 
tells us that though the average is $3145.13 is inaccurate if we are observing central tendencies of our data.




## Question 2: For this question youâ€™ll need to use SQL. Follow this link to access the data set required for the challenge. Please use queries to answer the following questions. Paste your queries along with your final numerical answers below.

How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total?

What is the last name of the employee with the most orders?

What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?
